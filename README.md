Important Note: Give the input in a noisefree environment or add a noise removing program that removes noises from the input audio signal by yourself to get the result with a 95% accuracy.


This PROJECT  uses a database of voices of male or female, based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. The dataset consists of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers. The voice samples are pre-processed by acoustic analysis in Matlab  with an analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz (human vocal range).
